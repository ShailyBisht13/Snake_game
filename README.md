#Snake game
The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer. The objective is to score as many points as possible by consuming the food while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body and the game boundaries.
Key Features:
Simple Controls: The snake is controlled using arrow keys or WASD keys (up, down, left, right).
Food Mechanism: When the snake eats the food, it grows in length and the score increases.
Game Over Condition: The game ends if the snake hits the walls or its own body.
No Sound: This version of the game does not include any audio effects, ensuring quiet gameplay suitable for silent environments or classrooms.
Score Display: The player’s score is updated and shown on the screen in real-time.
Speed Increase (optional): Difficulty can be increased by gradually speeding up the snake as the game progresses.
